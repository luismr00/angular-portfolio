                        These percentages summarize my overall skills that can be found under my resume.
                        My proficiency is highest over fullstack as opposed to other languages such as C, C++, Java, Ruby, etc.
                        That is because I've been focusing more on developing my frontend and backend skills, but I can always pick up any previous or new language if the occasion arises.
                        <!-- Overall, it should just take me a couple of weeks to get used to any other programming languages since most them are very similar to each other. -->

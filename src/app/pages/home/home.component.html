                        <p>Hi, my name is Luis, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University Northridge and also a veteran from the U.S. Navy. 
                            My service in the military consisted of working in patient care as the rate or title of a Hospital Corpsman (2012 - 2017). 
                            While performing my duties in the medical field, I later realized I wanted to work with computers instead. 
                            Changing jobs in the Navy to something computer related was rather difficult, so I decided to finish my service honorably and went back to school to pursue Computer Science once my contract ended.

                        <p>Upon leaving the service, I decided to move to Los Angeles instead of my original hometown of Chicago to go to school.
                            There, I first started attending school in Los Angeles City College and later transferred to CSUN to pursue my Bachelor’s Degree. 
                            It took my 5 years to finish my degree, but I managed to finish in the end and learned a lot during my time in college. 
                            Plus, I also managed to get summer internship in 2021 over with Snapchat. 
                            There I learned more about full stack and app development along creating other things such as lenses. 
                            <!-- Overall, I can say I’ve gained enough experience and confidence to build about anything and can’t wait to start my new journey as Software Engineer over the following years. -->

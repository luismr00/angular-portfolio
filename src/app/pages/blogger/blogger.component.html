                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    This project is an update from an older database college class project.
                    At first glance one can notice this site looks very similar to Twitter when looking at the updated site. 
                    However, there were two goals in mind while updating this project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve the UI from the old project without worrying about design originality and to be able to make it responsive.</li>
                    <li>Communicate front and back between the client and the backened using CRUD and RESTful API requests to fetch data or make any updates to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additionally, both projects have a few differing functionalities to each other.
                    All of the functionalities for the old project were related to the course based on the requirements from the professor as portrayed on the following gif.
                    You can still have a look at these requirements by visiting the repo at the end of this demo through the videos included in the README section.
                    For the new version I only used some of these functionalities but went ahead in adding new ones to make it work closer to a social media application.
                    One important thing to be mindful is that there's still plenty of room for improving this newer version of course.
                    However, this update was more of a prototype to show what can be done as opposed to displaying a final product instead.

                    The site is also responsive in case you decide to test it with a phone or tablet. 
                    Just be aware that some components might still be missing some responsive adjustments that might have been missed while developing the project.

                    Note: Some devices such as Apple products might prevent you from signing into the site. 
                    In case you encounter this issue, you would have to first disable ‘Prevent cross-site tracking’ under the browser settings that you are trying to use. 
                    The reason why this happens is because the client and backend from this project are hosted separately between Netlify and Heroku. 
                    In the case you rather avoid these steps, it is recommended to use browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. 
                    I do want to apologize in advance for this inconvenience. 
                    Although, these hosting platforms were used with the goal of deploying this project for free.

                    The first thing a user will encounter is the login page.
                    A new user has the option to register as well as mentioned below under the login submit button.
                    For registering a new account, the site doesn't require users to input a valid email which instead can be anything (i.e. example@gmail.com).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Additionally, any time a user visits one of the existing endpoints without signing in first will always be returned here or when their user session expires which is meant to last up to 24 hours before it asks users to log back in.
                    Once the user signs in, they will be redirected to the homepage where the first thing that will show up will be blogs from people the user follows.
                    A user can also choose to log out any time by clicking their username over the bottom left of the page.

                If you used Twitter before then posting will be very similar with Blogger. 
                The main difference is that this site requires users to tag their blogs with hobbies. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In this case, a user will be forced to select hobbies of their choice first before attempting to post any blogs.
                    The reason for this was so users can have the ability to filter out blogs they'd like to see or not based on their tags. 
                    It also gives users an idea of what type of people they want to follow or not.
                    This is quite an issue with a lot of social media platforms where people end up arguing when certain topics are touched upon throughout posts.
                    Therefore, the site gives a solution to this problem by filtering out the type of blogs a user wishes to see to avoid the need of unfollowing people anytime a user reads any unpleasant posts from someone else.
                    More information about filtering can be found in one of the sections below.

                <p>
                    There are two methods for searching users.
                    One of these methods is by knowing their
                    username. The search field will help
                    narrow down similar users based on the
                    characters or substring that a user is
                    typing while searching.
                    The other method is by selecting the
                    search option for users with mutual
                    hobbies. This method makes it easier
                    for users to connect with new people
                    and especially with those who share
                    the same scope of interests.
                    In the case a user follows another user who
                    already follows them then they will start
                    showing up as friends on the right.

                    This is where a user can find all of their
                    own personal blogs. These blogs don't
                    show up with the rest of the other blogs
                    from the homepage but this can always
                    be changed. Some might want to see their
                    blogs with rest over the home page while
                    others may not.
                    Moreover, a user can find more information
                    about someone such as their total number
                    of blogs, followers, and users they follow.
                    If the user clicks over the followers or
                    followings, then they will be redirected
                    to another page where it displays all of those users respestively.

                    Going back to the homepage, a message

                    as a result will display options for

                    A user can select any blog they wish to

                    rating attached it. However,
                    a user is limited to commenting a blog only
                    once at the moment. They also cannot comment
                    their own blogs either. Certainly the limit can 
                    always be changed. Yet, the reason it was developed
                    this way was to practice database queries that 
                    implements one-to-one, one-to-many, and 
                    many-to-many database relationships. Afterall,
                    this project was initially assigned from a database
                    class.
